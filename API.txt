API 
----
Application Programming Interface
It allows two applications to communicate.

Types of APIs
REST API (most common)
SOAP
GraphQL

✅ HTTP Basics
Methods: 
GET(Read) 
POST(create) 
PUT(update) 
DELETE

Status codes:
200 → Success
404 → Not Found
500 → Server Error

✅ JSON
Data format used in APIs
{
  "name": "Vaishnavi",
  "role": "Backend Developer"
}

✅ Tools
Postman (API testing)
Browser DevTools
curl



REST API --> Representational State Transfer
-------
REST (Representational State Transfer) is a way to build APIs using HTTP methods to perform operations on resources.
or
“REST API is an architectural style that uses HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources in a stateless manner.”

It allows frontend and backend to communicate using standard HTTP methods.

🔹 Key Concepts of REST API

1️⃣ Resource

Everything is treated as a resource.
Example:
/users
/products
/orders

2️⃣ HTTP Methods (CRUD Operations)

Method	Work	Example

GET	Read data	GET /users
POST	Create data	POST /users
PUT	Update data	PUT /users/1
DELETE	Delete data	DELETE /users/1


3️⃣ Status Codes
200 → Success
201 → Created
400 → Bad Request
401 → Unauthorized
404 → Not Found
500 → Server Error

4️⃣ Stateless

REST API does NOT store client session data.
Each request must contain all required information.

Example (Node.js + Express)
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
   res.json({ message: "All users" });
});


🔹 REST Principles

Client–Server architecture
Stateless
Cacheable
Uniform Interface
Layered system
